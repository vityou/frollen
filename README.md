# Frollen, [Frog](https://docs.racket-lang.org/frog/index.html) + [Pollen](http://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/)

Frollen is an attempted combination of frog and pollen.  It is designed to be a version of pollen more suitable for writing blogs.  I also made it so I could gain a better understanding of racket, so it is more a proof of concept at this point.  It is built from the ground up, so you are probably better off using either pollen or frog for whatever you want to do that this, however, you are welcome to try it out when it becomes somewhat stable.  It is mostly useless as of now however.

Most of the credit goes to the authors of Pollen and Frog.
